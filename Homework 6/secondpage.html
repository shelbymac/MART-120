<h2>The Yellow Wallpaper</h2>
<body>
    One of my favorite short stories is The Yellow Wallpaper. It is about a woman who is suffering from postpartum depression.
    Her husband tells her to stay inside to make it better, but she only gets worse. She starts seeing a woman trapped in the yellow wallpaper in her home
    and only feels more trapped herself. By the end of the story, she is convinced that she is the woman trapped behind the wallpaper, so she tears it down.
    Her husband comes home and faints upon seeing her, and she only creeps over him.<br>

    This story is from the 19th century when no one really understood women's issues, so the husband had told her to do something that he thought would help but
    ultimately only made things worse.<br>
